# Google Colab Adaptation of Shap-e for 3D Generation

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to sharing Google Colab adaptations of OpenAI's Shap-e model notebooks. The original Shap-e model is designed for generating 3D shapes from prompts, and these notebooks make the process accessible directly within Google Colab. 

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Text to 3D Notebook**: This adaptation allows you to input a text prompt, from which it generates a 3D representation. The generated 3D objects can be saved as OBJ files, and can also be rendered into GIFs for visualization purposes.

2. **Image to 3D Notebook**: This notebook is tailored to transform image prompts into 3D models. It performs optimally when the image has a clear focus on the object of interest, with the background removed. The resulting 3D shapes can be saved as OBJ and PLY files, as well as rendered into GIFs for easy viewing.

These notebooks were specifically adapted from the original Shap-e Jupyter notebooks to ensure seamless compatibility with Google Colab. For a more detailed guide on how to use these notebooks, visit our YouTube channel, [BrutFab](https://www.youtube.com/@BrutFab).
